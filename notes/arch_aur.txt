It increasingly seems that getting stuff from AUR will be fiendish.

1. Saltstack has no AUR state
  -- (can I write this?)
  -- Accepted solution is to instead run a custom repo and stick it in the source list
2. This custom repo runs on arch, and BlueRidge is vaguely debian-ish
  -- (hack it so it runs on debian?)
  -- Could run arch in a docker container
3. (Assuming problems will arise from dockerizing this thing, then maintaining the docker stack on BR)

I'm on Gentoo now, but in the event that arch again comes up, the plan was to do the docker container thing.
