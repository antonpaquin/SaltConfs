The proper format for changing package names based on OS is:

{% set packagename = {
  'Arch': 'archpackage',
  'Gentoo': 'gentoo/package',
}.get(grains.os_family) %}

like so.

Lots of debian/raspbian things (raspis) will be broken as I don't have debian
names in yet.

Also lots of arch things might be broken because they're actually using debian
names. Not quite sure, but it's easy enough to fix when it comes up.

To check the os_family value:

salt 'myTarget' grains.get os_family
