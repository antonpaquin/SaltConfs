I probably won't be able to figure out perfect salt bootstrapping with gentoo.

USE flags generally cause some sort of circular dependency problem that needs
to be manually resolved.

Here are some errors and how to manually fix them:

----------
          ID: chromium
    Function: pkg.installed
        Name: www-client/chromium
      Result: False
     Comment: Error occurred installing package(s). Additional info follows:

              needed changes:
                  ----------
                  use:
                      - >=dev-libs/libxml2-2.9.4 icu
                      - >=media-libs/harfbuzz-1.3.1 icu
                      - >=sys-libs/zlib-1.2.8-r1 minizip
                      - >=media-libs/libvpx-1.5.0 svc
     Changes:
----------

What's going on: chromium wants special use flags on a few packages

How to fix: Currently, I'm checking over each flag to see if it looks like
something that should be added (Seems like icu should be added in this case)
and manually emerging the rest.
USE="minizip" emerge sys-libs/zlib
USE="svc" emerge media-libs/libvpx

              AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'unevaluated_atom'
     Changes:
----------

What's going on: atom is only supported in the ~amd64 testing branch. No clue
why the error message looks like it does.

How to fix: If I stick /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords in salt, this kind
of error should mostly be resolved. If not, either manually add it, or emerge
the package again --autounmask-write

      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: net-p2p/deluge
     Changes:

What's going on: deluge here had a use flag dependency issue
mp3? any-of( mad smpeg )

How to fix: temporarily or permanently fix the issue. Here I permanently added
mad
